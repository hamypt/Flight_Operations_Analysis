# Flight Operations Analysis

  
This project analyzes flight operations data to identify trends, optimize scheduling, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency. The dataset contains detailed flight segment information including origin, destination, carrier, number of passengers, and more.

*Using the T-100 Segment (All Carriers) datasets from BTS: https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=FMG&QO_fu146_anzr=Nv4+Pn44vr45*  

The datasets from BTS require a lot of cleanups before they could be imported into the MySQL database, and alteration after being imported. 
Some of the queries for the database tables will reflect this to some extent.
