# Flight Operations Analysis

  
This project analyzes flight operations data to demonstrate statistics, identify trends and patterns. The analyses done include: descriptive statistics and summary, flight analysis (routes and aircraft utilization), time series analysis (monthly trends, performance over time), geo analysis (airport and region), operational efficiency analysis (by airline and load factor) and some advanced analysis including predictive analysis, cohort analysis, segmentation, combined segmentation and time series analysis.  


The dataset contains detailed flight segment information including origin, destination, carrier, number of passengers, and more.
*Using the T-100 Segment (All Carriers) datasets from BTS for the year 2023: https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.aspx?gnoyr_VQ=FMG&QO_fu146_anzr=Nv4+Pn44vr45*  

The datasets from BTS require a lot of pre-processing and cleanups before they could be imported into the MySQL database, and alteration after being imported.  
Some of the queries for the database tables will reflect this to some extent.
